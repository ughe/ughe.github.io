title: "GDB Testing, ChangeLogs, and Expanding Vagrant"
---

This is a follow up on "[Building GDB From Source]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-build-gdb-source %})", and uses the
vagrant environment described in the previous post. It covers doing
a bunch of basic things, which are largely independent of each other.

# Generating a Patch:

Patches are git diffs and can be generated:

* From the last commit: `git format-patch -1 HEAD`
* From unstaged changes `git diff > changes.patch`

# Generating a ChangeLog:

Use the `mklog` command [from the GDB wiki](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ContributionChecklist#Properly_Formatted_GNU_ChangeLog).

1) [Download](https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/contrib/mklog?view=co) the file or run

``` bash
wget -O mklog https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/contrib/mklog?view=co
```

2) Give executable priviledges

``` bash
chmod +x mklog
```

3) Run on the PATCH file:

``` bash
./mklog changes.patch > ChangeLog
```

4) Explain the ChangeLog

``` bash
emacs ChangeLog
```

# Testing a Patch:

This part is based off of the "[Working on GDB](https://gbenson.net/?p=292)" approach from gbenson.net.

Find the latest branch [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/news/), i.e. `gdb-8.2-branch` and then check it out (or just use `HEAD`):

``` bash
git checkout gdb-8.2-branch
```

1) Build and then run the testsuite without any changes:

``` bash
mkdir 8.2 && cd 8.2
../configure --enable-targets=all --with-expat
make
make check -j4 >& ../8.2.log
cd ..
```

2) Build and then run the testsuite with the patch:

``` bash
git apply changes.patch
mkdir 8.2-changes && cd 8.2-changes
../configure --enable-targets=all --with-expat
make
make check -j4 >& ../8.2-changes.log
cd ..
```

3) Diff the file:

``` bash
diff 8.2.log 8.2-changes.log
```

# Exporting a Patch from Vagrant:

1) Run `vagrant ssh-config` and find the values `Port` and `Identity File` in the output.

2) Copy the desired file from vagrant to the host machine:

``` bash
scp -P {Port} -i {IdentityFile} vagrant@127.0.0.1:~/gdb/changes.patch .
```

# Expanding a Vagrant Box:

In order to accomodate the size of multiple GDB installations, the
default Debian box needs to be made bigger, since it only has about
8GB of space. This involves two parts: expanding the size of the
VirtualBox disk partition and expanding the file system.

1) Expanding the VirtualBox disk size:

First, convert the `stretch.vmdk` disk file to a `stretch.vdi` one and
make it bigger and then covert it back. It will be located within the
`VirtualBox VMs` folder. This approach is common [[1]](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/resizing-virtualbox-disk-image) [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11659005/how-to-resize-a-virtualbox-vmdk-file).

On Unix:
``` bash
vagrant halt
cd ~/VirtualBox\ VMs/debian_default_*
VBoxManage clonehd stretch.vmdk stretch.vdi --format vdi
VBoxManage modifyhd stretch.vdi --resize 50000
rm -f *.vmdk
VBoxManage clonehd stretch.vdi stretch.vmdk --format vmdk
rm -f *.vdi
```

On Windows: (Replace `USERNAME`)
```
vagrant halt
cd "C:\Users\USERNAME\VirtualBox VMs\debian_default_*"
"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" clonehd stretch.vmdk stretch.vdi --format vdi
"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyhd stretch.vdi --resize 50000
del *.vmdk
"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" clonehd stretch.vdi stretch.vmdk --format vmdk
del *.vdi
```

This resizes the disk size to 50GB. 20GB would also work (use `--resize 20000`).

Return to the vagrant directory. Then run:

``` bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

2) Expand the primary partition size:

Check the file system:

``` bash
df -h
```

This should show that `/dev/sda1 has 8.7G capacity mounted on /`. If
there is a different disk instead, then use that one going forward.


Next print out the partitions:

``` bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

There should be three: Linux, Extended, and Linux swap / Solaris.

Then run fdisk and the following commands (not the comments):

``` bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
d           # Delete all partitions
1
d
2
w           # Write changes
```

Create a new primary partition:

``` bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
n           # New partition
p           # Primary partition
1           # At /dev/sda1
<enter>     # Default start location (at 2048)
+45G        # Partition size
No          # Don't remove the ext4 signature
w           # Write changes
```

Create swap partition:

``` bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
n           # New partition
e           # Extend partition
4           # At /dev/sda4
<enter>     # Default start location
<enter>     # Partition size maximum
w           # Write changes
```

Change partition type to swap:

``` bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
t           # Chang Partition Type
4           # At /dev/sda4
82          # Linux swap / Solaris
w           # Write changes
```

Restart the vagrant box (Note that it may take a while this time with
some error messages):

``` bash
logout
vagrant halt
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

3) Resize the file system to take up the whole partition:

``` bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
```

``` bash
sudo mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda4
sudo tune2fs -U random /dev/sda4
y
sudo blkid
```

Finally copy the UUID of /dev/sda4 and write it in the file below,
replacing the UUID under the `# swap was on /dev/vda5 during installation`
comment (and change the comment):

``` bash
emacs /etc/fstab
```

Then restart with:

``` bash
logout
vagrant halt
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

And running: `df -h` should show the new expanded size.
