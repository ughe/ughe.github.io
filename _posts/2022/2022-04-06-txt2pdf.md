title: "Converting Plaintext to PDF"
---

`txt2pdf` is a tool to convert a plaintext file to PDF. By default, it uses Courier 10 point font, which can fit about 78 characters across a line and 56 lines on a page. The command works by:
* paginating the input using the `pr` command. This also inserts the file's creation timestamp, the filename, and the page number in the header
* expanding tabs to spaces (width 8)
* appending the `.br` troff directive to each newline with `sed`[^1]
* converting to troff and then postscript and then pdf using `troff | grops | ps2pdf`

You can find the `txt2pdf` command at [github.com/ughe/txt2pdf][1]. Here is the full command:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Converts plaintext to PDF. Courier 10 point font. 78 cols x 56 rows
set -o pipefail
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
  >&2 echo "usage: $0 [-p12] [-n] [-2] abc.txt > abc.pdf"; exit 1; fi
PS=10 # Default font size
if echo "$@" | grep -q -- '^ *-p[0-9][0-9]* '; then # -p12 must be 1st
  PS=`echo "$@" | sed -nr 's/^ *-p([0-9]+) .*/\1/gp'`; shift; fi
# Format: 1) font size $PS 2) .br every newline 3) delete last line
FMT='1s/^/.ps '${PS}'\n/;s/$/\n.br/g;s/\\/\\\\/g;$ d'
pr "${@}" | expand | sed "$FMT" | troff -Tps -fC | grops | ps2pdf - -
```

We can use `txt2pdf` to convert itself to PDF using the following invocation:

```
./txt2pdf -n -h "txt2pdf" ./txt2pdf > txt2pdf.pdf
```

And here is the resulting `txt2pdf.pdf` that was outputted:

{::nomarkdown}
<object data="/data/2022/txt2pdf.pdf" width="100%", height="300px", type="application/pdf"></object>
{:/}

## Additional Examples

In addition to converting itself, `txt2pdf` has three more examples in the [repository][1]:

1. Comparing C and Rust "hello world" assembly output on x86-64 (intel)
2. Generating a table of arithmetic problems (multiplication) and answers
3. Printing out poems in 12 point font with line numbers (["Kubla Khan"][4] and ["Ulysses"][5])[^2]

We will discuss the C vs. Rust example, which prints the assembly output of their respective hello world programs side by side. The lines are truncated after about 30 characters, which makes assembly a good example since often source code or poems are longer than 30 characters wide.

Here are the hello world files for C and Rust[^3]:
* `hello_c.c`
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
  }
  ```
* `hello_rs.rs`
  ```rust
  fn main() {
      print!("hello, world\n");
  }
  ```

After compiling (with `-O3`) to assembly using the [Makefile here][2], we run `txt2pdf` with the `-m` flag and both `*.S` assembly files. C is on the left and Rust is on the right. Here is the output:

{::nomarkdown}
<object data="/data/2022/hello_c_vs_rs.S.pdf" width="100%", height="300px", type="application/pdf"></object>
{:/}

### Compiler Versions

See the [Makefile][2] used in `examples/hello` for the full methodology. Here are the versions used:

```
$ gcc --version
Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin21.4.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

$ rustc --version
rustc 1.56.1
```

## Conclusion

`txt2pdf` is a handy tool for converting plaintext to PDF without installing more powerful commands.

[^1]: Simplification. We also: 1) insert the font size `.ps` directive at the start of the file; 2) Escape all backslashes by replacing them with two backslashes; and 3) Remove the last line (which is always empty and was introduced by `pr`)
[^2]: Public domain poems sourced from Project Gutenberg
[^3]: Note: the actual [hello_rs.rs][3] file has more variations attempting to generate fewer asm lines.
