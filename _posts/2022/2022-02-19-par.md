title: "Parallelizing Bash Scripts"
---

`par` is a tool to parallelize multiple commands and view the output all on one stdout stream, with color-coding. The inspiration for `par`'s appearance comes from [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose), which clearly separates the output of one process from another. `par` is open source and available at [https://github.com/ughe/par][0]. Here's an example of `par` in action with netcat servers and clients:

![par example](/data/2022/par_netcat.png)

The terminal screenshot above demonstrates the output of the following `par` command:

```
par './nc_listen.sh 1234' './nc_listen.sh 4321' 'echo bravo' './nc_hello.sh 1234' './nc_hello.sh 4321'
```

This runs five processes. Two are netcat servers on ports :1234 and :4321 and two are netcat clients. One process just echoes `bravo`. Here are the two `nc_listen.sh` and `nc_hello.sh` scripts that are being run in parallel:

1. `nc_listen.sh`
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then >&2 echo "usage: $0 1234"; exit 1; fi
    echo "Starting netcat on :$1 ..."
    lsof -i :$1 | awk '/nc /{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
    nc -l $1
    ```

2. `nc_hello.sh`
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    sleep 1
    if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then >&2 echo "usage: $0 1234"; exit 1; fi
    for i in `seq 1 3`; do echo hello world $i; done | nc 127.0.0.1 $1
    ```

Finally, here's the plaintext of the image above:

```
par                 | Started 5 procs. Warning: lines truncated around 4096 chars. Waiting for any nonzero exit. PIDs: 7731 7740 7750 7757 7764 
./nc_listen.sh 1234 | Starting netcat on :1234 ...
./nc_listen.sh 4321 | Starting netcat on :4321 ...
echo bravo          | bravo
`echo bravo` exited with code 0 (PID: 7750)
./nc_listen.sh 1234 | hello world 1
./nc_listen.sh 1234 | hello world 2
./nc_listen.sh 1234 | hello world 3
./nc_listen.sh 4321 | hello world 1
./nc_listen.sh 4321 | hello world 2
./nc_listen.sh 4321 | hello world 3
`./nc_listen.sh 1234` exited with code 0 (PID: 7731)
`./nc_listen.sh 4321` exited with code 0 (PID: 7740)
`./nc_hello.sh 1234` exited with code 0 (PID: 7757)
`./nc_hello.sh 4321` exited with code 0 (PID: 7764)
par                 | Done. Exit code: 0
```

The [ANSI color codes][2] are not shown in the text above, although they would be if the output was piped or redirected to a file.

# Interworkings

The `par` command is about 81 lines and is at: [https://github.com/ughe/par][0].

1. Defines `println` (which calls `print_color`) to produce color-coded, tagged lines
2. Defines `pad` and `unpad` for preventing interleaving. Inspired by [http://catern.org/pipes.html][1]
3. For each argument (command)
    * Executes command in the background and captures its PID
    * Captures command's stdout/err and pads it then appends to the `UNIFIED` pipe
4. Prints the number and PIDs of all procs that were started
5. Backgrounds a process to continuously unpad `UNIFIED` and write to stdout
6. Registers a trap to end straggler processes on a Ctrl-C interrupt
7. Waits until any PID has non-zero exit or all PIDs exit zero
    * Checks every PID every second to see if it has stopped yet. Once it stops:
    * Prints the command name, that it exited, the exit code, and its PID
    * Continues waiting if the exit code was zero (increments a counter too)
    * Otherwise kills all PIDS and 1-level deep of their children
8. Cleans up and prints "Done" along with the exit code

There's also a `Makefile` that supports `make test` and `make install`. The tests only demonstrate output (no assertions). Install only works if go is installed since it attempts to copy the executable to `$GOPATH/bin`.

# Alternatives

There are many alternatives to `par`. For example, you could start each process by hand, write a short script, or just use `xargs` such as:

```
echo '"./command1" "./command2"' | xargs -n1 -P`nproc` -I {} sh -c "echo '{}'; {}"
```

Note on macOS `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` is used instead of `nproc`.
