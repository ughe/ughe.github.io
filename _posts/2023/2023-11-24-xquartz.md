title: "XQuartz on macOS"

# Motivation

Running X11 on macOS is possible via [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org). Examples of applications that use the X protocol include [Xfig](https://www.xfig.org) for drawing vector graphics and [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) for running a Desktop User Interface. This post covers installing XQuartz on macOS 14 (Sonoma) and testing it by running Xfig.

# Install

First, install XQuartz on macOS using Homebrew:

```
brew install xquartz
```

Next, run XQuartz (if it works, it will hang; if it fails, the command will exit immediately):

```bash
xquartz
echo $?
```

The expected output of the above command `echo $?` is to print `1`, which indicates a non-zero status code (error). To fix the error, read the system logs to find out what went wrong.

## Reading XQuartz Error Logs

Open the `Console` app in macOS i.e. `open Console`. Then navigate to the `Log Reports` section and select the most recent entry `org.xquartz.log`. Error message looks similar to:

> ```
> X11.app: DISPLAY does not look like a launchd set variable, unsetting.
> X11.app: main(): argc=2
> 	argv[0] = /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin
> 	argv[1] = --listenonly
> Waiting for startup parameters via Mach IPC.
> X11.app: No launchd socket handed off, unsetting DISPLAY
> X11.app: do_start_x11_server(): argc=1
> 	argv[0] = xquartz
> [ 25024.976] Xquartz starting:
> [ 25024.976] X.Org X Server 21.1.6
> [ 25024.976] _XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0,directory /tmp/.X11-unix will not be created.
> [ 25024.976] _XSERVTransSocketUNIXCreateListener: mkdir(/tmp/.X11-unix) failed, errno = 2
> [ 25024.976] _XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: failed to create listener for local
> [ 25024.976] (EE) 
> Fatal server error:
> [ 25024.976] (EE) Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running(EE) 
> [ 25024.976] (EE) Server terminated with error (1). Closing log file.
> ```

The key part is that the directory `/tmp/.X11-unix` does not exist and failed to be created.

## Solution

To fix the error, create the directory, give ownership to `root`, and set the `DISPLAY` env variable as done below:

``` bash
mkdir -p /tmp/.X11-unix
sudo chown root /tmp/.X11-unix/
launchctl setenv DISPLAY /tmp/.X11-unix/X0:0
```

Although not required, the following command may also be useful:

``` bash
defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 dpi -int 110
```

## Run XQuartz

Finally, verify XQuarts is working by running it:

```
xquartz
```

Note the command should not return (unless you send CTRL-C or CTRL-\ to end it). Otherwise, go back to the error logs step and keep iterating to resolve the error messages.


To demonstrate that XQuartz is working, in another terminal run:

```
brew install xfig
xfig
```

Like `xquartz`, the `xfig` command should not return if it runs successfully, and it will open up a GUI using the X11 protocol (via XQuartz).


Note: The `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory will not be persisted across reboots and, therefore, needs to be re-created as described above after each boot.
